# If you encounter any issues, please report them

# Bugs or issues are mostly fixed within hours.
#
#
# Here you can edit the whole GUI.
# You can set GUI titles, the size and
# item names, lores, materials and slots.
# Don't remove any values or keys.
#
# You also can add new items to your GUI.
# This can be done under gui.<GUI>.s.<YourItemName>
# The name needs to be unique in this section.
# Example:
#
# gui:
#   lands:
#     title: '&8Your Lands'
#     size: 27
#     s:
#       close:
#         name: '&cClose'
#         lore:
#         - '&7Close this menu.'
#         - ' '
#         - '&8- &7You can open it again'
#         - '  &7with &8/&3Lands menu&7.'
#         material: 'RED_STAINED_GLASS_PANE'
#         slot: 9
#
# Please note: You need to set all values
# otherwise Lands will auto generate values.
# Also you can't set items where list items
# are configured. Means if for example the
# list in the Lands GUI goes from slot
# 10 - 12 you can set any items with
# the slot 10, 11, 12. They will be ignored.
#
#
# You also can apply new placeholders.
# This can be done under gui.<GUI>.p.<YourItemName>
# The name needs to be unique in this section.
# Example:
#
# gui:
#   lands:
#     p:
#       placeholder_1:
#       material: 'GRAY_STAINED_GLASS_PANE'
#       from: 1

# Added enabled: false to a item to disable it.
# You can set every item as a custom head:
# Visit /https://minecraft-heads.com/custom-heads
# Then copy the 'value:' and paste it at 'material:'
